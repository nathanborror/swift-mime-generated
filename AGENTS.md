# Project Instructions

- Keep the README file up-to-date.
- Keep the README easy to read and as short as possible.
- The README serves as the primary place for documentation, do not create other documentation files like a CHANGELOG.
- Do not create example code or sample code, that is what tests are for.
- Use the latest Swift Testing framework (e.g. @Test and #expect)
